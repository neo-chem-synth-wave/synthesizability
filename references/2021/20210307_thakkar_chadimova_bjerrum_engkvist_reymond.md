# Abstract
Computer aided synthesis planning (CASP) is part of a suite of artificial intelligence (AI) based 
tools that are able to propose synthesis routes to a wide range of compounds. However, at present 
they are too slow to be used to screen the synthetic feasibility of millions of generated or enumerated 
compounds before identification of potential bioactivity by virtual screening (VS) workflows. Herein 
we report a machine learning (ML) based method capable of classifying whether a synthetic route can be 
identified for a particular compound or not by the CASP tool AiZynthFinder. The resulting ML models return 
a retrosynthetic accessibility score (RAscore) of any molecule of interest, and computes at least 4500 times 
faster than retrosynthetic analysis performed by the underlying CASP tool. The RAscore should be useful for 
pre-screening millions of virtual molecules from enumerated databases or generative models for synthetic 
accessibility and produce higher quality databases for virtual screening of biological activity.
