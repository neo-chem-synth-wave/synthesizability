# Abstract
Determining whether a molecule can be synthesized is crucial in chemistry and drug discovery, as it guides experimental 
prioritization and molecule ranking in de novo design tasks. Existing scoring approaches to assess synthetic feasibility 
struggle to extrapolate to new chemical spaces or fail to discriminate based on subtle differences such as chirality. 
This work addresses these limitations by introducing the Focused Synthesizability score (FSscore), which uses machine 
learning to rank structures based on their relative ease of synthesis. First, a baseline trained on an extensive set of 
reactant-product pairs is established, which is then refined with expert human feedback tailored to specific chemical spaces. 
This targeted fine-tuning improves performance on these chemical scopes, enabling more accurate differentiation between 
molecules that are hard and easy to synthesize. The FSscore showcases how a human-in-the-loop framework can be utilized 
to optimize the assessment of synthetic feasibility for various chemical applications.
