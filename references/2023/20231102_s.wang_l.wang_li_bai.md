# Abstract
With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, more and more computational models for generating 
new molecules are being developed. However, we are often confronted with the question of whether these compounds are easy 
or difficult to synthesize, which refers to synthetic accessibility of compounds. In this study, a deep learning based 
computational model called DeepSA, was proposed to predict the synthesis accessibility of compounds, which provides a useful 
tool to choose molecules. DeepSA is a chemical language model that was developed by training on a dataset of 3,593,053 molecules 
using various natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, offering advantages over state-of-the-art methods and having a much 
higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), i.e., 89.6%, in discriminating those molecules that are 
difficult to synthesize. This helps users select less expensive molecules for synthesis, reducing the time and cost required 
for drug discovery and development. Interestingly, a comparison of DeepSA with a Graph Attention-based method shows that 
using SMILES alone can also efficiently visualize and extract compoundâ€™s informative features.
