Welcome to the computer-assisted **synthesizability** research project !!!


## Installation
A standalone environment can be created using the [git](https://git-scm.com) and [conda](https://conda.io) commands as
follows:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/neo-chem-synth-wave/synthesizability.git

cd synthesizability

conda env create -f environment.yaml

conda activate synthesizability-env
```

The [synthesizability](/synthesizability) package can be installed using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) command as follows:

```shell
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```
